# What is this?

This package is a minimal network rate monitor for notebook computers.
It measures the transfer rate (incoming and outgoing) on a wireless
network card.

There are no configuration options for the program. The code is simple
and can accomodate some changes.

# Installation

The python file together with the icon are the entire program. Extract
then both in the same directory, and then simply run the python file.

The shell script adds the program to the system menu. This can be done
manually as well in most modern environments.
